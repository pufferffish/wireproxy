A wireguard client that exposes itself as a socks5/http proxy or tunnels.

# What is this
`wireproxy` is a completely userspace application that connects to a wireguard peer,
and exposes a socks5/http proxy or tunnels on the machine. This can be useful if you need
to connect to certain sites via a wireguard peer, but can't be bothered to setup a new network
interface for whatever reasons.

# Why you might want this
- You simply want to use wireguard as a way to proxy some traffic.
- You don't want root permission just to change wireguard settings.

Currently, I'm running wireproxy connected to a wireguard server in another country,
and configured my browser to use wireproxy for certain sites. It's pretty useful since
wireproxy is completely isolated from my network interfaces, and I don't need root to configure
anything.

Users who want something similar but for Amnezia VPN can use [this fork](https://github.com/artem-russkikh/wireproxy-awg)
of wireproxy by [@artem-russkikh](https://github.com/artem-russkikh).

# Sample config file
```
# The [Interface] and [Peer] configurations follow the same semantics and meaning
# of a wg-quick configuration. To understand what these fields mean, please refer to:
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/WireGuard#Persistent_configuration
# https://www.wireguard.com/#simple-network-interface
[Interface]
Address = 10.200.200.2/32 # The subnet should be /32 and /128 for IPv4 and v6 respectively
# MTU = 1420 (optional)
PrivateKey = uCTIK+56CPyCvwJxmU5dBfuyJvPuSXAq1FzHdnIxe1Q=
# PrivateKey = $MY_WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY # Alternatively, reference environment variables
DNS = 10.200.200.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = QP+A67Z2UBrMgvNIdHv8gPel5URWNLS4B3ZQ2hQIZlg=
# PresharedKey = UItQuvLsyh50ucXHfjF0bbR4IIpVBd74lwKc8uIPXXs= (optional)
Endpoint = my.ddns.example.com:51820
# PersistentKeepalive = 25 (optional)

# TCPClientTunnel is a tunnel listening on your machine,
# and it forwards any TCP traffic received to the specified target via wireguard.
# Flow:
# <an app on your LAN> --> localhost:25565 --(wireguard)--> play.cubecraft.net:25565
[TCPClientTunnel]
BindAddress = 127.0.0.1:25565
Target = play.cubecraft.net:25565

# TCPServerTunnel is a tunnel listening on wireguard,
# and it forwards any TCP traffic received to the specified target via local network.
# Flow:
# <an app on your wireguard network> --(wireguard)--> 172.16.31.2:3422 --> localhost:25545
[TCPServerTunnel]
ListenPort = 3422
Target = localhost:25545

# STDIOTunnel is a tunnel connecting the standard input and output of the wireproxy
# process to the specified TCP target via wireguard.
# This is especially useful to use wireproxy as a ProxyCommand parameter in openssh
# For example:
#    ssh -o ProxyCommand='wireproxy -c myconfig.conf' ssh.myserver.net
# Flow:
# Piped command -->(wireguard)--> ssh.myserver.net:22
[STDIOTunnel]
Target = ssh.myserver.net:22

# Socks5 creates a socks5 proxy on your LAN, and all traffic would be routed via wireguard.
[Socks5]
BindAddress = 127.0.0.1:25344

# Socks5 authentication parameters, specifying username and password enables
# proxy authentication.
#Username = ...
# Avoid using spaces in the password field
#Password = ...

# http creates a http proxy on your LAN, and all traffic would be routed via wireguard.
[http]
BindAddress = 127.0.0.1:25345

# HTTP authentication parameters, specifying username and password enables
# proxy authentication.
#Username = ...
# Avoid using spaces in the password field
#Password = ...
```

Alternatively, if you already have a wireguard config, you can import it in the
wireproxy config file like this:
```
WGConfig = <path to the wireguard config>

# Same semantics as above
[TCPClientTunnel]
...

[TCPServerTunnel]
...

[Socks5]
...
```

Having multiple peers is also supported. `AllowedIPs` would need to be specified
such that wireproxy would know which peer to forward to.
```
[Interface]
Address = 10.254.254.40/32
PrivateKey = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=

[Peer]
Endpoint = 192.168.0.204:51820
PublicKey = YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY=
AllowedIPs = 10.254.254.100/32
PersistentKeepalive = 25

[Peer]
PublicKey = ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ=
AllowedIPs = 10.254.254.1/32, fdee:1337:c000:d00d::1/128
Endpoint = 172.16.0.185:44044
PersistentKeepalive = 25


[TCPServerTunnel]
ListenPort = 5000
Target = service-one.servicenet:5000

[TCPServerTunnel]
ListenPort = 5001
Target = service-two.servicenet:5001

[TCPServerTunnel]
ListenPort = 5080
Target = service-three.servicenet:80
```

Wireproxy can also allow peers to connect to it:
```
[Interface]
ListenPort = 5400
...

[Peer]
PublicKey = YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY=
AllowedIPs = 10.254.254.100/32
# Note there is no Endpoint defined here.
```
# Health endpoint
Wireproxy supports exposing a health endpoint for monitoring purposes.
The argument `--info/-i` specifies an address and port (e.g. `localhost:9080`), which exposes a HTTP server that provides health status metric of the server.

Currently two endpoints are implemented:

`/metrics`: Exposes information of the wireguard daemon, this provides the same information you would get with `wg show`. [This](https://www.wireguard.com/xplatform/#example-dialog) shows an example of what the response would look like.

`/readyz`: This responds with a json which shows the last time a pong is received from an IP specified with `CheckAlive`. When `CheckAlive` is set, a ping is sent out to addresses in `CheckAlive` per `CheckAliveInterval` seconds (defaults to 5) via wireguard. If a pong has not been received from one of the addresses within the last `CheckAliveInterval` seconds (+2 seconds for some leeway to account for latency), then it would respond with a 503, otherwise a 200.

For example:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = censored
Address = 10.2.0.2/32
DNS = 10.2.0.1
CheckAlive = 1.1.1.1, 3.3.3.3
CheckAliveInterval = 3

[Peer]
PublicKey = censored
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 149.34.244.174:51820

[Socks5]
BindAddress = 127.0.0.1:25344
```
`/readyz` would respond with
```
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
< Date: Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:54:59 GMT
< Content-Length: 35
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
<
{"1.1.1.1":1712796899,"3.3.3.3":0}
```

And for:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = censored
Address = 10.2.0.2/32
DNS = 10.2.0.1
CheckAlive = 1.1.1.1
```
`/readyz` would respond with
```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:56:21 GMT
< Content-Length: 23
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
<
{"1.1.1.1":1712796979}
```

If nothing is set for `CheckAlive`, an empty JSON object with 200 will be the response.

The peer which the ICMP ping packet is routed to depends on the `AllowedIPs` set for each peers.
